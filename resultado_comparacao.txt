# AWS vs Azure GPU Pricing Comparison

Here is a detailed comparison of the pricing between AWS P3 instances and their Azure equivalents:

| Instance Type        | Cloud Provider | GPU                       | vCPU | RAM (GiB) | Storage (GB) | Price per Hour USD |
|----------------------|----------------|---------------------------|------|-----------|--------------|--------------------|
| p3.2xlarge           | AWS            | 1 x Tesla V100           | 8    | 61        | 150 EBS      | $3.06              |
| STANDARD_NC6S_V3     | Azure          | 1 x Tesla V100           | 6    | 112       | 736 SSD      | $3.06              |
| p3.8xlarge           | AWS            | 4 x Tesla V100           | 32   | 244       | 300 EBS      | $12.24             |
| STANDARD_NC24RS_V3   | Azure          | 4 x Tesla V100           | 24   | 448       | 1474 SSD     | $12.24             |
| p3.16xlarge          | AWS            | 8 x Tesla V100           | 64   | 488       | 900 EBS      | $24.48             |
| STANDARD_NC24S_V3    | Azure          | 4 x Tesla V100           | 24   | 448       | 2948 SSD     | $24.48             |
| p3dn.24xlarge        | AWS            | 8 x Tesla V100           | 96   | 768       | 1800 NVMe SSD| $31.20             |
| STANDARD_ND48S_V2    | Azure          | 8 x Tesla V100           | 48   | 896       | 3200 SSD     | $31.20             |

## Analysis and Recommendations

Based on the comparison above, pricing for equivalent compute power in terms of GPU, CPU, and RAM is almost the same between AWS and Azure. However, there are additional factors that should be considered for a full cost analysis:

1. **Storage**: Azure seems to be offering more storage per instance compared to AWS which is an added advantage if your application requires significant data storage.

2. **Data Transfer**: The costs for data transfer (particularly outbound transfer) can vary substantially between providers. Depending on your usage patterns, this could influence your total cost.

3. **Region**: Prices can vary by region within the same provider, so the costs in your specific region may differ from the numbers quoted above.

4. **Reserved Instances or Savings Plans**: Both AWS and Azure offer significant discounts for upfront commitments, which can also affect the price.

5. **Your Application Needs**: The "right" provider for you depends not only on price but also on your specific use case, application needs, and team expertise. For example, you might pick a provider based on their machine learning capabilities, or the maturity of their managed Kubernetes service, etc. 

Given these considerations, I recommend doing a further analysis that takes into account these cost factors and your specific requirements.
